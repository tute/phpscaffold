h1. About phpScaffold

*phpScaffold* quickly generates CRUD scaffold pages for PHP/MySQL. It takes a
table dump and some file names as input from a browser session, and cooks
XHTML pages for editing the model.

It features basic HTTP or Session based authentication; and the generated
forms responds to column types text, datetime, (var)char and bool (int(1)).

I've started it from the public copy at phpscaffold.com, to be able to use it
in any new model I need, without having to tweak by hand automatable tasks
(_id est_, for no more reinventing wheels!).


h2. Installation and usage

# Go to @index.php@, and seed the form with your table schema.
# You can go to @tmp/table_name/@ to grab the files, or copy&paste the code
  from the shown textareas to where you want. (Make sure that @tmp/@ has
  write permissions)
# Adjust login and MySQL configuration from first lines of @functions.php@.
## Edit MySQL connection information.
## Change @$login@ information (by default it's 'admin', 'pass').

doesn't generate it.


h2. To do list

* Make it aware of date and blob columns.
* Handle more than one table at a time.
* Table name and titles get broken if 'name' column exists.
* Make auth.php dynamic variable.
* Modularize forms and column array.
** Generate cols array at global scope, and use it the four times.
** Make print_form($action = {add|edit}) in func.php
