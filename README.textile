h1. About phpScaffold

*phpScaffold* quickly generates simple CRUD scaffold modules for PHP/MySQL. It
takes a project name and a schema dump from a browser session, and cooks HTML5
pages for editing it's tables.

It features session based authentication; searching, sorting and paging
facilities in listing page; and the generated forms responds to column types
@text@, @date@, @datetime@, @(var)char@ and @bool (int(1))@.

I've started it from the public copy at phpscaffold.com, to be able to use it
in any new simple model I need, without having to tweak by hand automatable
tasks (_id est_, for no more reinventing wheels!).


h2. Installation and usage

# Go to @index.php@, and seed the form with your schema dump.
# You can go to @tmp/table_name/@ to grab/test the files
  (make sure that @tmp/@ has write permissions for the web server).
# Adjust MySQL info and users (by default it's 'admin', 'pass') from @inc.config.inc@.
# Start using it!

h3. Some comments

p{font-size:80%}. The table must be up and running; *phpScaffold* doesn't change anything in the database.

p{font-size:80%}. You may add text search criteria adding 'text' as third parameter to @search_options@ (in search page).

h2. To do list
* Errors on tables without primary key.
* date and datetime fields shouldn't be surrounded by @<legend>@.
* Distinguish between @int@ and @char@ columns, to tie text/number search options automatically.
* Date/date-range search.
* Upload files capability?
* showEmpty option for @build_options()@.


h2. For developers

You may run tests running on the console @cucumber features@. You'll have to
setup cucumber as described on @https://github.com/aslakhellesoy/cucumber/wiki/PHP@,
and to tweak the URL on @features/step_definitions/authentication_steps.rb@.
