h1. About phpScaffold

*phpScaffold* quickly generates CRUD scaffold pages for PHP/MySQL. It takes a
table dump and some file names as input from a browser session, and cooks
XHTML pages for editing the model.

It features basic HTTP or Session based authentication; and the generated
forms responds to column types @text@, @date@, @datetime@, @(var)char@ and
@bool (int(1))@.

I've started it from the public copy at phpscaffold.com, to be able to use it
in any new model I need, without having to tweak by hand automatable tasks
(_id est_, for no more reinventing wheels!).


h2. Installation and usage

# Go to @index.php@, and seed the form with your table schema.
# You can go to @tmp/table_name/@ to grab the files (make sure that @tmp/@ has
  write permissions), or copy&paste the code from the shown textareas to where
  you want.
# Adjust MySQL configuration and login (by default it's 'admin', 'pass') from
  first lines of @functions.php@.

change anything in the database.


h2. To do list

* Make it aware of blob columns.
* Handle more than one table at a time.
** Make it aware of table relationships?
* Modularize forms and column array.
** Generate cols array at global scope, and use it the four times.
** Make print_form($action = {add|edit}) in func.php
* Use quotes for array offsets (convert constants to strings).
* Table name and titles get broken if 'name' column exists.
* Make auth.php dynamic variable.
