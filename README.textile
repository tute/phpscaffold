h1. About phpScaffold

*phpScaffold* quickly generates CRUD scaffold pages for PHP/MySQL. It takes a
table dump and some file names as input from a browser session, and cooks
XHTML pages for editing the model.

I've started it from the public copy at phpscaffold.com, to be able to use it
in any new model I need, without having to tweak by hand automatable tasks
(_id est_, for no more reinventing wheels!).


h2. To do list

* Modularize forms.
* Minutes in datetime with range option.
* Generate two pages?: functions and page.
* Make it aware of date columns (and other types as well).
* Make it aware of presence of many tables, and organize CRUDs in subfolders.
* "Download all" option doesn't work.
